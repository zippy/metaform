Metaform
========

This plugin provides a system for defining and generating forms for complex data-collection
which includes workflows, listings, and statistics.  Forms are defined using a domain specific
languages which makes it easy to separate the data model from the presentation.  The system
also includes a "widget" system that pre-defines a number of html widgets including radio-button
and check-box groups, text-based date entry, etc.. which include javascript nubs built in.

== Getting Started

* Use the generator:

 ./script/generate metaform

This will add:
 - two migrations (which you need to rake db:migrate for) 
 - the "forms" directory where you will define your forms
 - a javascript file to your public/javascripts
 - the default css stylesheet to public/stylesheets
